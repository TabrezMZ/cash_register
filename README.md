# cash_register
 A JS app where you can enter the bill amount and cash given by the customer and know minimum number of notes to return and also ruppe value of those notes.
 
 This is a really good app from utility use case. Banks, Shops, Daily Traders can use this app. The logic in this app is complex and intresting at the same time. Using Trunc and Math functions on a loop basis is gave me confidence in JS as a beginner. App's UI is very simple and by far this is my best UI properties/conditions done through JavaScript.
